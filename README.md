# GAMMCOR
Authors: Kasia Pernal and Michal Hapka

## Instalation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pernalk/GAMMCOR.git 
```

2. Change directory to GAMMCOR and create a directory OBJ:
```
chdir GAMMCOR
mkdir OBJ
```

3. Set the path to mkl libraries in `Makefile` and compile using ifort with `make`:
```
make
```
This will create GAMMCOR executable:
```
gammcor
```
4. Run the verification suite:
   1. Obtain test input files
   ```
   git clone https://gitlab.version.fz-juelich.de/trex/GammCor
   ```
   2. Copy TESTS to a main GAMMCORR directory with a compiled code
   3. Run test suit

   ```
   gammcor_verify.py
   ```
